Aviation Risk Analysis

📊 Project Overview
As our company prepares to expand into the aviation sector, understanding the safety and risk profiles of different aircraft is critical to making informed, data-driven investments. This project analyzes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023—sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)—to identify low-risk aircraft types best suited for commercial and private operations.

Using Python and Tableau, we cleaned and analyzed the data, calculated aircraft-level risk scores, and developed an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders explore accident patterns and evaluate aircraft safety.

🚀 Business Problem
Which aircraft models present the lowest risk to the company as it enters the aviation industry?

To help leadership make confident purchasing decisions, we analyzed historical accident data to:

Identify aircraft types with consistently low accident and fatality rates

Reveal key risk factors such as flight type, location, and severity

Recommend data-driven strategies for aircraft acquisition

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (Jupyter Notebook) for data cleaning, analysis, and preprocessing

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA

Tableau for interactive dashboard creation

Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

📈 Key Findings
Aircraft Make X and Model Y had the lowest fatality-to-accident ratio over the last 30 years.

Private flights had higher accident rates compared to commercial operations, especially in rural states.

Accidents due to weather-related factors and pilot error were most common during takeoff and landing phases.

📌 Business Recommendations
Start with Aircraft Models A and B, which demonstrate strong safety records and low historical fatality rates.

Avoid older aircraft and light personal planes, which are overrepresented in fatal accidents.

Focus initial operations in regions with low historical incident rates and strong aviation infrastructure.
